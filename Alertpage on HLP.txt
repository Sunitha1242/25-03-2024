Whenever HLP ticket comes and asked for to check either data is coming or not then first we have to open or check in ORACLE(PEDW)(it contains only one day-previous day data)

select * from chsi_usage.chsi_dly_usage_hdp_pre_stg
select * from chsi_usage.chsi_dly_usage_hdp_pre_stg where equip_addr='F80C58BC2E90'------------to find host name and IP address in pedw table


select rdc_rec_creation_dt from chsi_usage.chsi_dly_usage_hdp_pre_stg group by Rdc_rec_creation_dt

select * from chsi_usage.chsi_dly_usage_hdp_pre_stg where CMTS_HOST_NM LIKE 'MACPGACV3WBZZ-HOLTOLMX04%' Order by 1


If we find data in oracle then we can simply close the hlp saying data is seen.

=========================================================================================

These queries are used for checking date in Hive table
this is the next step we have to follow when we don't see data in ORACLE dly table.

First check in Daily , Hourly and 15 minutes order using the available data like Mac Address, OLM/ONT

We need to find out which server and which IP Address

==========================================================================
We are seeing data in hive table now. Hence we are closing the HLP ticket.Please let us know if you have any issues.
===================================================================================
If suppose data is not there in a daily table then we have to go check for service classes(PODS table)-
select svc_class_nm,usage_type_desc,Usage_type_cd,Reject_flg from User_reference.Chsi_svc_class_usage_type_xref

any usage type is  Data then it will move into usage hourly table
any usage type is  other than Data then it will move into non usage hourly table

reject flag Y means do not send for rating eventhough the data usage is 'D' type. 
-
First check wheteher Raw data is coming or not by using following commands.
If it is coming then the data will be stored in Hive table then check in hive for data according to your dates otherwise data won't store in Hive.
First enter into the server 
samis folder
then date
enter below command using that particular mac address   and IP address

/opt/incognito/ipdr-tool/bin/ipdrtool csv -m    B0DAF95BAED9   100.122.126.43_samis_20221109*.ipdr

By following this command will get Service class name and some other fields also 

we need to check for CMTS name,Service class amd Mac address ---all three must be there then only the data will proceed to 15 minutes table.ServiceOctetValue shouldn't be zero
